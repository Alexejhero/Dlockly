## Hosting the bot

Dlockly works fine by its self using its [website](https://dlockly.glitch.me).

### Making a bot profile
Before you can host your bot, you need to have a bot.

You can do that by going to the [discord developer panel](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/).

If promted sign in to __your__ discord account, and then you should be greeted with this page: ![dev panel](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/606876870063030273/606876892078932016/unknown.png)
From here you want to click the "New Application" button. This popup will appear: ![create applicaion](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/606876870063030273/606877373014736896/unknown.png)
Now you want to type in the name for your bot and hit "Create"

You will get this page: ![new application](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/606876870063030273/606878414477066245/unknown.png) 
If you want you can change the description of the bot and add an icon.

Next you want to go to the "Bot" setion on the side and this tab will open: ![create bot](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/606876870063030273/606879322363658260/unknown.png)
This will popup: ![confirm create](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/606876870063030273/606880123064549387/unknown.png)
Choose "Yes, do it!" and then this page will pop up: ![a wild bot appeard](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/606876870063030273/606884324427563009/unknown.png)
Leave this tab open for later

### Setting up the project:
Dlockly is hosted on [glitch](https://glitch.com) and thats what we will be hosting for this tutorial.
go to [glitch](https://glitch.com) and create an account by hitting sign in and choosing the method of your choosing: ![sign in](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/606876870063030273/606886083136978975/unknown.png)
then you want to click New Project and Clone from Git Repo. This will prompt you to enter a url and then you put in `https://github.com/AlexejheroYTB/Dlockly`, or if you want you just can click [this link](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/import/git?url=https://github.com/AlexejheroYTB/Dlockly).
![clone from git repo](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/606876870063030273/606886831413395492/unknown.png)
Now you should be presented with this screen if everything went well: ![editor](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/606876870063030273/606888668493512708/unknown.png)
Now you want to click the name on the top left (it will be something like `alexejheroytb-dlockly-#`). Click the name in the new box that appears and change it to what you want (not: it will be the url so if you name it `mycoolbot` than your site will be `mycoolbot.glitch.me`) ![name](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/606876870063030273/606889477541199879/unknown.png)
After this you want to click New File on the top left and name it `.env` and then paste this in: 
```env
DISCORD_TOKEN=
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=
DISCORD_GUILD_ID=
DISCORD_ROLE_ID=
```
Now you need to get these values

### Values:
Remeber the bot page I told you about earlier? Go back there. Click the Copy button under token. 

***__NEVER SHARE YOUR TOKEN WITH ANYONE!!!__*** 

![token](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/606876870063030273/606894021448826950/unknown.png)

once done paste your token in your .env file under `DISCORD_TOKEN`

Now go back to the discord bot page and click the copy button under client secret

![secret](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/606876870063030273/606894839283318833/unknown.png)

once done paste your secret in your .env file under `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET`

Now you need to go to discord. In the settings go to appearance and turn on developer mode if it isn't already.

Now go find the server you want to have the bot in, and right click it and hit, copy ID

Paste your id in your .env file under `DISCORD_GUILD_ID`

If you want a admin role, do the steps above but for the role in the server above and paste it in `DISCORD_ROLE_ID`. This is not needed though

### Setting up server: 
Now you need a redirect uri. This is a security measure to prevent people from pertending as your bot. Go back to your bot page and click OAuth2
This page will load: ![OAuth2](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/606876870063030273/606903427229810698/unknown.png)
click Add Redirect under redirects and put `https://project.glitch.me/auth` where project is the name from glitch earlier and then click save changes.

Now you need to invite the bot. Scroll down under this and you'll see this: ![invite](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/606876870063030273/606904091683323925/unknown.png)
click bot and then click copy. Paste this link into your browser and then invite the bot.
