#### Introducing Dlockly, _A fully customizable Discord bot with a Scratch-like interface!_
(I totally did not just copy that from the repo topic)

### Anyway!

You may be wondering what exactly it does.

Well let me tell you, it does **NOTHING!**

Like, I'm not kidding. It literally does nothing **UNTIL YOU CONFIGURE IT!**

### I'm guessing that you want to know how to configure it!

### WELL LET ME TELL YOU!

#### Do you know what Scratch is?

_uh, no_

#### oof, i figured that. Thankfully I know how to use Google:

##### _Scratch is a block-based visual programming language and online community targeted primarily at children. Users of the site can create online projects using a block-like interface. The service is developed by the MIT Media Lab, has been translated into 70+ languages, and is used in most parts of the world._

#### Basically, Dlockly is configurable using a Scratch-like interface

_what is Scratch?_

#### I JUST TOLD YOU WHAT SCRATCH WAS! READ PLEASE!

_ok i read it. what now?_

### Nothing, that's all.
